        <h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
        <p>A few high-school students from the Willoughby Township have a created a new non-profit organization called Pollinate BC. <br/>
            The mission of the organization is to engineer custom-made beehives optimized for the harsh BC climate.<br/>
            In light of the recent, rapid decline in the bee population, and the crucial role they play within the ecosystem, we have launched this cause to ameliorate that issue.<br/>
            Our plan is to build a few beehives, donate them to different schools, and then let them be apart of their community. Both spreading education, as well as rejuvenating the bee population. 
        </p>
